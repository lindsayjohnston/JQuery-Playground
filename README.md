# JQuery-Playground
Examples of common uses of JQuery 

## Sources:

To include jQuery in my HTML doc, I used the Google CDN for jQuery: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js

I went through most of the examples at https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/ to get the hang of jQuery.

To include code snippets on the page I used Prism: https://prismjs.com/index.html.

For the menu bars on mobile screens I used Font Awesome:https://fontawesome.com/
